## What you're seeing

So far, the project has a very simply layout
- The Fidget view has buttons and switchs, and more interactive items on the view that make noises and give haptic feedback, to mimic items like fidget cubes
- The Notes view is where any of the notes you have made can be stored and read later, as well as deleted
- The different emotion views play music and goe through different colors to help calm the user down, as well as give them an area to write notes down about whats going on or how they're feeling
- Lastly, theres the AR screen. THIS PART IS STILL IN THE WORKS! I am looking forward to thei particular part. Right now it simply shows your some reasurring phrases. In future, I hope to make it a very simple game type AR interface to help peopl improve their moods
